## Go Web Application with PostgreSQL and Docker

This project is a web application built with Go and utilizes PostgreSQL for persistent data storage. Docker facilitates containerized deployment for efficient management and distribution.

**Key Technologies:**

* Programming Language: Go (replace with specific version if needed)
* Database: PostgreSQL (replace with specific version if needed)
* Deployment: Docker (replace with specific version if needed)

**Project Overview:**

This application leverages Go's capabilities for building robust web services and connects to a PostgreSQL database for storing and retrieving data. Docker enables packaging the application and its dependencies into a container, simplifying deployment across various environments.

**Project Structure:**

* `cmd`: Encapsulates the application's main entry point.
* `config`: Stores configuration files like database connection details.
* `internal`: Houses internal packages containing the application's core logic.
* `pkg`: Reusable packages are located within this directory.
* `api`: Defines API endpoints and their corresponding handlers.
* `models`: Models representing database entities are defined here.
* `static`: Stores static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

**Dependencies:**

* Go (replace with specific version if needed)
* PostgreSQL (replace with specific version if needed)
* Docker (replace with specific version if needed)
* [List any other dependencies as needed]

**Setup:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
